# Games Collection (gamescollection_fe)
This project is the front end of my games collection app. The app consists of a tool to have an on-hand inventory of my video games collection to avoid purchasing duplicates or for quick consulting.

The project idea is to be used by me only, however, it could escalate in future versions.

## Technologies
* ReactJS
* Vite
* react bootstrap v5
* axios

## Setup & usage
This project is meant to be used alongside [gamescollection_be](https://github.com/keff6/gamescollection_be), which provides the backend for this project. However, if you want to run the app alone it will not crash so you can have a look at the disposition of the app.

+ Git clone the repo
+ npm install
+ runs with *npm run dev*
+ the app is served on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
